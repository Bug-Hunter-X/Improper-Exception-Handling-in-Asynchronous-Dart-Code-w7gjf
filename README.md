# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: improper exception handling in asynchronous operations. The code includes a `fetchData` function that makes an HTTP request and handles potential exceptions. However, the exception handling is not robust enough, as it rethrows the exception without providing specific information. The `main` function catches the exception but lacks specific handling for different exception types. This makes it difficult to determine the root cause of the error.

## Bug Description
The provided `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from a remote API. While it uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during the HTTP request, it rethrows any exceptions without additional context. This can lead to challenges in debugging, as the caller of `fetchData` only receives a generic error message without details about the underlying issue. The `main` function's `try-catch` further reduces the helpfulness of the exception message. 

## Solution
The solution involves improving the exception handling in both the `fetchData` and `main` functions.  The updated `fetchData` function provides more specific error handling, including checks for HTTP status codes and more descriptive error messages. The `main` function's `catch` block is refined to handle more specific exceptions to improve debugging.
